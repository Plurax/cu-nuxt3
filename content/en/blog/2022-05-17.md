# Scanning double sided documents

I own a Brother DCPL2550DN. This is a scan/print device which can put the scanned documents directly to an FTP target. I use this to digitize paper I want to keep on my Synology NAS. A problem is scanning double sided pages, as it cant scan with duplex. *pdftk* can help with that:

First I scan the odd pages. Then I turn the stack around and scan the even pages. With the tool its then possible to combine the PDF to the correct document. *end-1* will cause to add even pages with reversed order to avoid resorting.

```bash
pdftk A=odd.pdf B=even.pdf shuffle A Bend-1 output merged.pdf
```
