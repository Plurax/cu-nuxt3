Running Docker on a Linux computer may cause connectivity issues in a German ICE train. If you are not able to enter the captive portal ([https://login.wifionice.de]), try to delete the docker network temporarily (sure not being able to use Docker then).

```bash
sudo ip -4 addr del 172.18.0.1/16 dev br-...
```

Dont know if this works on Windows though...
