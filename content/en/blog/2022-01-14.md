# Logitech Streamcam on Ubuntu

I own a Logitech Streamcam, which I use at the Desktop and I always wondered why it stops working after the first usage under Ubuntu 20.0.4. After that, apps dont find it anymore and I cant proceed with video conferencing.

Recently I found the issue: Sometimes length matters. The cable is long, adding the length of the internal connection to the front panel, its even longer. So it was realy instable so it worked only for the first time after boot.
After checking

```bash
lsusb | grep Logitech
```

```bash
| Bus 003 Device 003: ID 046d:0893 Logitech | Inc. Logitech StreamCam    |
| Bus 003 Device 005: ID 046d:c08e Logitech | Inc. Logitech StreamCam    |
| Bus 003 Device 004: ID 046d:c328 Logitech | Inc. Corded Keyboard K280e |
```

I was able to search for problems in

```bash
dmesg
```

with the USB ID. There it was stated that enumeration failed.

Solution: A small USBA to USB C adapter for some bucks fixed the issue.
