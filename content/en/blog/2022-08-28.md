# Open Supaplex

Long time ago I was fascinated by a DOS game called Supaplex. This is a game similar to C64 game "Boulder Dash", but with some additional tiles and features. Someone created an SDL rewrite which is compatible with most systems: [Open Supaplex on Github](https://github.com/sergiou87/open-supaplex "Open Supaplex"). 111 levels with increasing frustation...no I mean difficulty level ;D.
