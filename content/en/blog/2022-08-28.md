# Open Supaplex

Long time ago I was fascinated by a DOS game called Supaplex. This is a game similar to C64 game "Boulder Dash", but with some additional tiles and features. Someone created an SDL rewrite which is compatible with most systems: [Open Supaplex on Github](https://github.com/sergiou87/open-supaplex "Open Supaplex"). 111 levels with increasing frustation...no I mean difficulty level ;D. 

## Building

Since the above link is a public Github repository, you just need to clone it on your local environment and you can build it. So first step is cloning the source and installing corresponding SDL libraries if not yet available:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sergiou87/open-supaplex
apt-get install libsdl2-2.0-0 libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-2.0-0 libsdl2-mixer-dev
```

Of course you need the usual building tools for C/C++ projects. The project uses several folders for different platforms. For linux you need to enter the linux folder and call the make target:

```bash
cd linux
make
```

## Execution

To make it executable, you need to copy the binary opensupaplex into the ressources folder, since there are all bitmaps, sound files and level ressources to make it work.

```bash
cp opensupaplex ../resources
cd ../resources
```

To execute the game you need to enter the resources folder and call the executable you just built:

```bash
./opensupaplex
```

Regard that the game will start in original resolution, todays highres screens may surprise you with a small game window - but you can enlarge it - SDL will do the scaling job for you. Have fun :)
